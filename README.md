# Quick-And-Simple-Platformer
A "simple" platformer, inspired by my (very old) Q&sp;SP series from scratch. (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/82253834/)
This parkour platformer is about momentum and speed, and the goal will be to get the best time. Collect coins and avoid lava.

This project is currently still in development :>

### How to run:
- Make sure you have the [Love2D graphics framework](https://love2d.org/) installed
- Download this repository
- Unzip the .zip and you should have a folder, enter it and rezip all the *contents* of said folder (not the folder)
- Rename the game.zip into game.love and double click it to run. If all has gone well, it should open as a game.
