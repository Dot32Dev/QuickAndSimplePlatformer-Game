# Quick-And-Simple-Platformer
A "simple" platformer, inspired by my (very old) Q&SP series from scratch. (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/82253834/)
This new parkour platformer is about momentum and speed, and the goal is to get the best time, collect coins and avoid lava.

### How to run:
Download an exe or .love from the [releases](https://github.com/Dot32IsCool/QuickAndSimplePlatformer-Game/releases) page, or alternatively:
- Make sure you have the [Love2D Lua framework](https://love2d.org/) installed
- Download this repository
- Unzip the .zip and you should have a folder, enter it and rezip all the *contents* of said folder (not the folder)
- Rename the game.zip into game.love and double click it to run. If all has gone well, it should open as a game.
