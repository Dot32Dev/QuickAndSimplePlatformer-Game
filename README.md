# Quick-And-Simple-Platformer
A "simple" platformer, inspired by my Q&amp;SP series from scratch. (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/82253834/)
This parkour platformer is about momentum and speed, and the goal will be to get the best time. Collect coins and avoid lava.

This project is currently still in development :>

##### How to run
- Download the [Love2D game framework](https://love2d.org/) and then download this repository. 
- Unzip the .zip and you should have a folder, entire it and zip all the contents of said folder.
- Rename the game.zip into game.love and double click it to run. If all goes well, it should open as a game.
